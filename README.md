# New Clone Project

This is a clean Next.js App Router skeleton that mirrors the architectural
patterns and folder conventions of a reference project without copying any
business logic or domain rules.

## Notes
- All feature, entity, and route implementations are placeholders.
- Replace TODOs with project-specific logic.
- TypeScript strict mode, ESLint, Tailwind, and provider/boundary patterns are preserved.

## Scripts
- `npm run dev`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run format`
